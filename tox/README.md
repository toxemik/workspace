# Get Started

Launch the ``tox`` script with the path name of the project you want to create:

```shell
./tox <project-path>
```
This will create the files and directory structure of the project:

- index.html
- src/
- src/main.js
- src/assets/
- src/components/
- src/components/hello.mjs
- src/views/
- src/views/index.mjs
